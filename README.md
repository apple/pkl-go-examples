# pkl-go-example

This repo contains sample projects that demonstrates Pkl <> Go integration.

Projects:

* `simple` is a basic web service that uses Pkl to drive configuration.
* `buildtimeeval` is like `simple` but moves evaluation from run time into build time.

This is a basic HTTP server that is configured via Pkl in the `pkl/` directory.

## Requirements

* Go >1.25
* Pkl >0.29.1
