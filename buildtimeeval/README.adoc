= Build Time Eval

This example is almost the same as link:../simple[simple], except that it moves evaluation from run time into build time.

At run time, instead of using the Pkl evaluator, it reads the embedded bytes and unmarshals it into a config struct.

== When to use this

During the course of evaluation, pkl-go will spawn the `pkl` CLI as a child process in order to execute the entrypoint Pkl programs.

Typically, evaluation happens at runtime, where the `pkl.Evaluator` API is used to eval Pkl data into Go data.
However, it's possible to move evaluation to build time, where the evaluated results are serialized into binary, then later unmarshaled.
This means that the Pkl CLI does not need to be available in the environment when running the application.

This approach is not feasible if:

* The Go application should be evaluating Pkl modules at runtime (e.g. if you are building a tool that allows configuration through Pkl)
* `read` or `import` requires access to runtime inputs (e.g. `dbPassword = read("env:DATABASE_PASSWORD")`, assuming that `DATABASE_PASSWORD` is only set at runtime).

== Project structure

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Directory |Description
|`pkl/` |Pkl configuration sources
|`gen/` |Generated Go sources from Pkl
|`configdata/` |Embedded Pkl binary data
|`internal/` |Internal Go files
|`cmd/` |Server entrypoint
|===

== Codegen

To generate new Pkl sources for the AppConfig module, run:

[source,bash]
----
go tool pkl-gen-go pkl/AppConfig.pkl
----

The code generator detects that the Go package for `AppConfig` is
`github.com/apple/pkl-go-examples/simple/gen/appconfig`, and the Go module
name is `github.com/apple/pkl-go-examples` (via the go.mod file), and
therefore places generated sources in `gen/appconfig`.

[[generate-config-data]]
== Generating config data

To generate config data, run `go run cmd/internal/generate-pkl-data`.
Alternatively, run `go generate ./...`, which will run both codegen and generate msgpack data.

== Starting the app

First, follow the steps to <<generate-config-data,generate config data>>.

[source,bash]
----
go run cmd/main.go
----

Alternatively, replace `go run` with `go build`, and start the resulting executable.
